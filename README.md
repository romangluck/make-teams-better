--- Description ---  
Make Teams Better is a project born from an idea originally presented at Moldova Developer Conference in November 2021. The Presentation focused on providing a list of best practices for teams, so the people can benefit from an efficient and friendly work environment.

Everyone can contribute their own best practices and consolidated page here that contains a continuously updated list for easy access here on GitHub.

Periodically the website page will be updated with latest best commits to this page.

This is a first draft, so it will be heavily edited within the upcoming time.

If someone has best practices of writing similar style of documents here on GitHub please share them via Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/roman-gluck/

------ Intro ------ 
In the modern world most software development teams and not only adopted some form of agile, because it's efficient and makes things easier to manage (to some extent of course).
Most of us want a Dream Team that helps us conquer mountains. Some people prefer working alone, and that is good, we don't force on people something they don't want. But when it comes to a complicated project, you would want to work in a team. Below you will find a list of recomendations that I personaly found improve team efficiency and enjoyment of working in a group.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------ Some key points ------
1. I'm not discovering the universe here, most of the things you will find in this list are best know practices
2. Treat these recommendations as a team health checklist, so you can ensure all is good in your team ambiance
3. This works for most agile teams, but practices from this list may be easily applied to any other type of team management 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------ Roles: The usual suspects ------ 
- Scrum Master
- Product Owner / Manager -
- Lead Dev / QA / Design -
- Agile Team Members - 

--- People are equal - Difference is in roles and responsobilities

--- So what can go wrong

1. Roles are missing
2. Hawaii Principle 
3. People don't respect role boundaries

------ Start of journey ------

Onboarding is an essential part of the team efficiency and growth. And yet it's the easiest place to fail. So here are some best practices you can adopt in your team.

1. Buddy System - Principle is extremly simple, a newcommer is assigned a person (not neceserally a direct team mate) that will be the greeting person to show around the persony everything around the company and/or project. The Buddy has the responsibility of explaining all of the administrative things an employee must know about the company, show where is the printer and how to use it, where to make coffee, show best places around the block to have lunch etc. Main point has to be welcoming and make the onboarding process of the person into the company as less painful and less awkward as possible. Also the Buddy is the the go person for any question

2. Welcoming Team - first days for a any new team mate are usually awkward, best thing to make the person to feel comfortable is to be welcoming. Invite them for a coffee, give the a tour of the project, tell about the team, introduce them to people and team mates. In short do all the best to integrate into the group. And most importantly let them know they can ask any question they have, and you are there to suport them. 

3. Onboading Checklist - have a checklist in written form for all of the things that a person has to do, complete, get, be informed about etc, when they enter the team and project. Best to keep that checkist somewhere in Confluence or any other documentation repository, so it's readily available when someone new joins in. This checklist makes sure nothing is forgoten and the person knows everything they should know.

4. Confluence + Terminology Page - Yes, we all hate writting documentation, and we have so many reasons why. But you must at least cover the essentials so a person knows about the project. Anything can go here: team strucutre, contact information, history of the project,  architecture of the project, technology stack, user flows, user manual for the product, video guides, feature description lists etc. You decide what is vital to know for a new team mate to know about the project. Have a dedicated Terminology Page with all the industry specific names that are used on a daily basis, so the person can have context faster in any meeting. 

5. Demo from Product Team - what proved to make onboarding super efficient is to have someone from product team to demo the product for the new colleague. This removes the awkward situation when the person doesn't understand what they are going to be building.
